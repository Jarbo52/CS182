### Taught by Professor [David Naumann](https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~naumann/)

## Assignments
1. Simple Dictionary
   * Linked List implementation of a dictionary
   * 50/50
2. Binary Search Tree
   * Implementation of a binary search tree
   * Utilizes a delete flag for deletion rather than pointer manipulation
   * 47/50
3. Graphs
   * Implementation of a directed graph
   * Created with either an adjacency matrix or linked list
   * 53.13/100
      * Infinite loop in edge method in initial submission caused a timeout on multiple test cases
4. Graphio
   * Implementation of an input/output system for previous graph assignment
   * 50/50
5. DFS/Topological Sort
   * Implemented [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) of a graph and a topological sort of a graph
   * 100/100
6. Sorting
   * Implementation of quick sort and insertion sort
   * Includes a testing method to compare time of sorting algorithms
   * 63.7/80
      * Textbook problems included in grade undone (-9)
7. AVL Trees
   * Implementation of an [AVL Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) (Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree)
   * Known Issues:
      * Calling remkey seg-faults
         * Method was extra credit and not done
   * 100/100
8. Transitive Closure
   * Implementation of a single method to find the transitive closure of a graph
   * Edge is 0 if path exists, no edge otherwise
   * 80/80
9. Minimum Spanning Tree
   * Implementation of creating a minimum spanning tree given a graph
   * Uses a priority queue which was also coded
   * X/100
